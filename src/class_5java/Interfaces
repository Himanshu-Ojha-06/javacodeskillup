Interface
 
It can have only abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
 
ALL the variables are public, static and final by default. It cannot be instantiated like the class using new Keyword.
 
It can be used to achieve loose coupling. (Plug or UnPlug)
 
using this, you can expose your implementation through your interface, not required to expose through your Class. External users use only interface not class.
It is the example of abstraction

Note
 
Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
 
Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.
